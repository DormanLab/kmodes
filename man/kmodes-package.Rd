\title{kmodes: Algorithsm for K-modes Categorical Data Clustering}
\description{
Implements several algorithm for k-modes, including Huang's algorithm [H97] and Hartigan and Wong's k-means algorithm adopted by Dorman & Maitra [DM21] for categorical data. Also implements several initialization methods. K-selection methods are available in the standalone command-line program.
}
\details{
The package kmodes provides only one function [kmodes()], which performs
