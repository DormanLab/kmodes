# Prerequisites <a name = "prerequisites" />

- kmodes requires [cmake](https://cmake.org) (3.5.0 or higher version) and [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org) (5.4.0 or higher version).
- kmodes requires Rmath, the [R Standalone Math Library](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html#The-standalone-Rmath-library).  Often, the Rmath library (libRmath.a or libRmath.so for Linux or libRmath.dylib for MacOS) will be installed with R, but not always.  Here are some other locations for the library.
	- r-mathlib on [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) and [Debian](https://www.debian.org/)
	- libRmath on [Fedora](https://ubuntu.com/), [CentOS](https://centos.org/), [Mageia](https://www.mageia.org/en/), and [Mandriva](https://www.openmandriva.org/)
	- Or if all else fails, you can install the Rmath standalone library from the repository [https://github.com/statslabs/rmath](https://github.com/statslabs/rmath)

# Installation <a name = "installation" />

kmodes has been tested under Linux and MacOS.

1. Clone the repository.

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/DormanLab/kmodes.git
    ```

2. Configure the project.

   ```sh
   cd kmodes/src
   cmake .
   ```

3. Compile kmodes.  The executable is called ```run_kmodes```.  It will appear in the ```src``` directory you are currently in.

   ```sh
   make
   ```

# Tutorial <a name = "tutorial" />

For this mini-tutorial, we assume you have compiled the executable ```run_kmodes``` and it is in your current directory.
All the files created in this tutorial are in the `demo` directory.

1. Simulate data consisting of 100 observations with 50 coordinates in 4 categories and relative abundances of 0.1, 0.2, 0.25, and 0.45.
Parameters 8.1 and 2.0 determine the amount of 'time' separating the modes and the observations from their modes.
The simulated data are written to file `sim.dat` and the simulation settings to `sim.out`, with **the true cluster membership of each observation in the first column**.
We set the random seed to 123 and do not actually run k-modes (`-n 0` means 0 initializations).

```
./run_kmodes --simulate 100 50 4 8.1 2.0 --pi 0.10 0.20 0.25 0.45 -f sim.dat -o sim.out -r 123 -n 0
```

2. Estimate the clustering given K=4 clusters using the Hartigan and Wong algorithm (```-w```), outputing the results in ```sim.hw.out```.
We ask for 100 randomly initializations and set the random number seed to 321.
We inform ```run_kmodes``` that the true cluster memberships are given in the first column (```-c 0```), and this information will be used to compute quantities like the adjusted RAND index.

```
./run_kmodes -f sim.dat -o sim.hw.out -k 4 -w -n 100 -i rnd -r 321 -c 0
tail -n 1 sim.hw.out	# vital statistics
```

3. Repeat using Huang's (1997) algorithm, which is the default.  Notice, we are using the exact same random initializations, since we set an identical seed.

```
./run_kmodes -f sim.dat -o sim.h97.out -k 4 -n 100 -i rnd -r 321 -c 0
tail -n 1 sim.h97.out	# vital statistics
```

Comparison of the last line of output on my system shows:
```
==> ../demo/sim.hw.out <==
1843 1.530000 0.051875 1868.530000 6.822074 0.947685 0.012844 0.959317 0.009732 0.058391 0.013943 0.365033 100
==> ../demo/sim.h97.out <==
1843 3.290000 0.093054 1887.360000 8.116644 0.916890 0.014290 0.929269 0.011482 0.102328 0.016519 0.410692 100

```
These numbers are the minimum value of objective function, the average and standard deviation of the number of iterations, the average and standard deviation of the objective function, the average and standard deviation of the adjusted RAND index, the average and standard deviation of the normalized mutual information, the average and standard deviation of the normalized variation of information, the total time taken, and the number of initializations.
We can see that Huang's algorithm took more time and obtained substantially higher average values of the objective function, but both methods found the true solution handily.

4. See if we can do any better by providing the true partition (```-p```).  (Actually, most initialiations already find the true clusters.)

```
tail -n 4 sim.out | head -n 1 > sim.part	# extract true partition from simulation output file
./run_kmodes -f sim.dat -o sim.h97.part.out -p sim.part -k 4 -c 0
```


# Preparing input <a name="input" />

The input is a simple text file with one observation per line, no header or comments, and coordinates separated by spaces.
The coordinate values should be non-negative integers.
```run_kmodes``` will issue a warning if they are not contiguous, but you can safely ignore this warning.
If available, the first column can contain the true cluster memberships, which should be provided as integers between 0 and K-1, inclusive and no values unused.


# Output Files <a name = "output" />

## Estimating clusters

```run_kmodes``` outputs results to the screen, but you will probably want it to also write the information to a file.
If you provide two arguments to ```-outfile```, free-form information will be output to the first file and the summary of each initialization will be output to the second file.
If you provide  a single argument, both outputs will go to the same output file.

### Informational output
The following information are output in the first output file.  Most entries are key/value pairs.
- `Seed:` The random number generator seed used.
- `Algorithm:` A string identifying the k-modes algorithm used.
- `Initialization:` A string identifying what kind of initialization method was used.
- `Run for N initializations` a line indicating the number of initializations run.  There will be this many lines of output in the second output file.
- `Number of clusters to estimate:` An integer with the user-selected value of $K$, number of clusters.
- `Initialization output file:` This key is included if the user provided a second filename to the `--outfile` argument.  This file will contain the initialization output.
- If the ```--column`` argument was provided, then these additional lines are provided:
	- `Number of true clusters:` An integer indicating the true number of clusters.
	- `True cluster assignments:` The next line contains the true cluster assignments of each observation, same order as in the data file.
	- `True cluster sizes:` The next line contains the true sizes of each cluster.
- `Best optimized criterion:` An integer indicating the best value of the objective function obtained.  The next line contains the contribution of each cluster to the overall objective.  The values on the next line sum to the value on this line.
- `Maximum AR:` If the `--column` argument was provided, then this line indicates the maximum achieved Adjusted RAND index.
- `Best cluster sizes:` This line contains the sizes of the clusters in the best solution.  Notice, the clusters may not be ordered in the same way as the true clusters.
- `Best solution originating seeds:` If random initialization was used, this line indicates the indices of the observations that yielded the best solution.
- `Best solution cluster assignments:` The next line will contain the cluster assignments of all observations in the best-scoring solution.
- `Best modes:`  The next $K$ lines specify the modes of the clusters found for the best-scoring solution.
- The last line is a concise summary of the run.  It contains $13$ numbers.  An example line looks like:
```
1843 1.530000 0.051875 1868.530000 6.822074 0.947685 0.012844 0.959317 0.009732 0.058391 0.013943 0.349907 100
```
The numbers are:

	- The minimum value of the objective function obtained.
	- The average number of initializations taken to converge.
	- The standard deviation in the number of initializations taken to converge.
	- The average value of the objective function obtained.
	- The standard deviation in the value of objective function obtained.
	- The average value of the adjusted RAND index (ARI) if `--column` was provided.
	- The standard deviation in the value of ARI if `--column` was provided.
	- The average value of the normalized mutual information (NMI) if `--column` was provided.
	- The standard deviation in the value of NMI if `--column` was provided.
	- The average value of the normalized variation of information (NVI) if `--column` was provided.
	- The standard deviation in the value of NVI if `--column` was provided.
	- The total time (in seconds) taken.
	- The total number of initializations performed.

### Initialization output
The output for each initialization, if directed to a separate file, is suitable for loading into R or a spreadsheet.
Here is a portion of the initialization output for the tutorial:
```
0 2 873 369 487 114 1843 inf 1.000000 -inf 1.000000 0.000000 0.004131
1 2 873 487 369 114 1843 1843 1.000000 1.000000 1.000000 0.000000 0.008764
2 2 487 369 873 114 1843 1843 1.000000 1.000000 1.000000 0.000000 0.013326
3 2 873 114 487 369 1843 1843 1.000000 1.000000 1.000000 0.000000 0.017918
```
The columns displayed are:

	- The initialization number.
	- The number of iterations to convergence.
	- The cost of each cluster (K=4 in this case).
	- The total cost.
	- The best cost so far, starts at infinity.
	- The adjusted RAND index of the current solution, if `--columns` argument provided.
	- The best adjusted RAND index so far, if `--columns` argument provided.
	- The normalized mutual information.
	- The normalized variation of information.
	- The total compute time used (in seconds). 

## Simulation

When simulating data, there are up to two output files.

### Simulated data
The simulated data are output in the file given as argument to `--file`.
The format is as described in (Input Files)[#input].
In addition, the first column contains the true cluster membership of the observation on that line.

### Simulation information
If requested via command-line argument `--outfile`, information about the simulation may also be output.
The data in this file are key/value pairs.
The meaning of each entry is provided below:

	- `Number of observations:` Integer specifying the number of observations simulated.
	- `Number of coordinates:` Integer specifying the number of coordinates in each observation.
	- `Number of categories:` Integer specifying the number of categories possible at each coordinate.  (Simulation data does not allow the number of categories to vary by coordinate.)
	- `Number of true clusters:`  Integer specifying the number of clusters simulated.  In parentheses it reports how many generated observations.
	- `CTMC times:` The times used in the continuous time Markov chain simulator.  The first number is the time separating the modes.  The second time is the time separating the observations from the modes.
	- `CTMC probabilities:` The probability a coordinate is altered in the mode relative to the ancestor, and the probability a coordinate is altered from the mode in an observation.
	- `Mixing proportions:` The probability of each of K clusters provided on the next line.
	- `Simulated modes:`  The true modes provided on the next K lines.
	- `Mode pairwise distances:` The Hamming distance between each pair of true modes on the next K lines in upper triangle format.
	- `Simulated cluster assignments:` The true cluster assignments are on the next line.
	- `Simulated cluster sizes:` The size of the simulated clusters on the next line.
	- `Data written to file:` The name of the file where the simulated data were written.


# Troubleshooting <a name = "troubleshooting" />

1. Please note that if you use ```run_kmodes``` to simulate data (```--simulate``` option), then it will output the true cluster identities in the first column.  It is very important that, when doing clustering, you use the ```--column 0``` option to inform ```run_kmodes``` so that it ***does not*** use this column of data for clustering.  Or remove the column before analysis.

2. ```run_kmodes``` is not very flexible about the data it can process.  It assumes that every category is a non-negative integer smaller than 256.  You can raise the limit by editing the ```constants.h``` file, redefining ```data_t```, ```KMODES_PRIu_data_t```, and ```KMODES_SCNu_data_t```, replacing the number 8 with 16 (upper limit: 65535) or 32 (upper limit: 4294967295).

3. If the categories in your dataset are not contiguous numbers, ```run_kmodes``` will warn you.  You can ignore the warning, or use the second arguments to option ```--file``` to modify the data file so the warning goes away.
