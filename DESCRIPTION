Description: Implements several algorithm for k-modes, including Huang's algorithm [H97] and Hartigan and Wong's k-means algorithm adopted by Dorman & Maitra [DM21] for categorical data. Also implements several initialization methods. K-selection methods are available in the standalone command-line program.
